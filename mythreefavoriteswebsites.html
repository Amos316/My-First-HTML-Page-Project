	<h1> My three favorite websites </h1>
	
	<h4>By Elisha Amos </h4>
		<p>My first favorite website is <span><a href="youtube.com" > youtube </a> </span>. i love youtube because i can basically find anything when it coms to DIY projects. from fixing cars, to basic plumbing or even trouble shooting a cell phone. the great thing with youtube is, most instruction have a visual to it to help see to understand what is being done</p>
		<p>My second favorite website is <span> <a href="facebook.com" > facebook </a> </span>. it is a way to stay intouch with friends and family that are far and near. it enhances communication and provide a way to see current pictures of people and places.
		<p>My third favorite website is <span> <a href="npr.com"> </a> npr </span>. this is public radio service which provides news with little to no bias. it also has a lot of international content on a regular basis which help to know whats going on around couple with the partnership with bbc which is broadcasted during non-peak hours. </body>
